# 👋 Hi, I’m Abiram!

🎓 3rd Year B.Tech in AI & Data Science @ KL University  
💡 Passionate about solving problems using Deep Learning, Machine Learning & AI APIs

I specialize in building AI-powered solutions by combining my knowledge of deep learning with modern web frameworks. I enjoy working on projects that bring machine intelligence to life — from image colorization models to AI-integrated productivity tools. I’m always eager to experiment with new AI techniques, APIs, and architectures to push the boundaries of what's possible.
